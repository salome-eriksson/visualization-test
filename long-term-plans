TL;DR
-----
 - not host it ourselves
 - allow adding python code to preprocess properties
 - integrate in lab
 - add tables (and more?)
 - when sharing via link, it should not take 1min+ to load

The current goal was to have an easy way to share a specific interactive
scatterplot via URL, for example for linking it in the issue tracker. As it is
currently set up (docker container hosted on ai-web) we can do exactly that,
without anyone needing to install the necessary python packages or clone the
repository.

In the future, we want to make the tool more powerful, ideally to the point
where it can be used as the "sole" tool for processing experiment data both
for issues and papers. One important capability for this is to allow the
user to specify how data from the properties file should be processed. This
most likely needs to be done by specifying python code.
The current setup does not easily allow this; instead a jupyter notebook setup
is most likely best. These notebooks could also be hosted somewhere else. One
thing to consider is that we still want to be able to easily share a plot (or
similar) that other people can see by just clicking a link, and that doesn't
require a 1 minute or more wait for the host to start a VM.
One intermediate solution both in terms of effort and usability would be to
share python notebooks on https://ai.dmi.unibas.ch/_experiments/ They can be
opened/edited in VS code locally, but we might have to look into what is
necessary to set things up correctly (i.e., that lab and the visualizer scripts
are available in the notebook). This might be interesting in combination
with https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, which allows to run
jupyter notebooks in the browser; but we would have to explore whether this is
sufficient.
