TODOS:

features:
- cactusplot
- upload properties file?
- cross select vertical?
- i-buttons for explaining parameters
- collapse groups of parameters with accordions
- option for renaming algorithms/config strings within the tool
- dedicated box for log and error message (akin to console output)
- cancel loading?
- WiseReport: comparison as popup instead of below the other tables

refactor:
- check that reports do things the same way as lab (eg mean values)
- Scatterplot: entries list -> regex with groups?
- index column width changing/too small?
- error messages (e.g. when properties is not a property file)
- combine Diff and Absolute Report?
  -> otherwise, try to avoid computing all aggregates etc two times
- scatter: why did I have shared_axes = False?
- see that we don't waste time when reports are initialized with specific values
  -> also a problem when clicking link?
  -> should help prepare for use in jupyter
- Floatpanel wrong height (see eg https://discourse.holoviz.org/t/tabulator-in-floatpanel-height-size-is-not-correct-mre-when-the-floatpanel-is-dynamically-added/6497)
  -> cannot use sizing_mode = "stretch_both" (table disappears completely)

other:
- move to aibasel on github
- setup issue tracker on github
