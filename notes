TODOS:

features:
- scatter allow for wildcards in entries_list (e.g *v1* *v2*)
- enable sorting in Tablereports
- scatter plot by order given in entries list
- use styling/min_wins in ProblemReport
- cactusplot
- Domain/Taskwise?
- upload properties file?
- loading screen when loading properties file?
- scatter parameters for marker type/color
- cross select vertical?

refactor:
- index column width changing/too small?
- floating point formatting
- error messages (e.g. when properties is not a property file)
- combine Diff and Absolute Report?
  -> otherwise, try to avoid computing all aggregates etc two times
- reduce load time for scatter when grouping by domain
- scatter: why did I have shared_axes = False?
- see that we don't waste time when reports are initialized with specific values
  -> also a problem when clicking link?
  -> should help prepare for use in jupyter
- Floatpanel does not close when removed programmatically
- Floatpanel wrong height (see eg https://discourse.holoviz.org/t/tabulator-in-floatpanel-height-size-is-not-correct-mre-when-the-floatpanel-is-dynamically-added/6497)
  -> cannot use sizing_mode = "stretch_both" (table disappears completely)
