QUESTIONS:

general:
 - Which extensions would be interesting? (e.g. cactus, domainwise, taskwise)
 - discord channel for discussion / me asking detail questions?
 - priority of jupyter compatibility?

details:
 - loading too long?
 - wildcards in scatter syntax?
 - mean/gmean
 - upload local properties needed?
 - table sorting needed?
 - formatting readability -> bright green hard to read (especially on gray but also in general)
________________________________________________________________________________

TODOS:

before sprint:
- gmean warnings
- Explanations:
  - aggregates taken over common for all (original) columns that are displayed
  - tables custom dicts
  - scatter entries list
  
maybe before sprint:
- cross select vertical?
- floating point formatting
- index column width changing/too small?
- enable sorting in Tablereports
- scatter allow for wildcards in entries_list (e.g *v1* *v2*)
- see to it that packages are on right version
- scatter plot by order given in entries list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

features:
- use styling/min_wins in ProblemReport
- cactusplot
- Domain/Taskwise?
- upload properties file?
- loading screen when loading properties file?
- scatter parameters for marker type/color
- Titles for Crosselector widgets

refactor:
- warning about reading in json
- error messages (e.g. when properties is not a property file)
- combine Diff and Absolute Report?
  -> otherwise, try to avoid computing all aggregates etc two times
- reduce load time for scatter when grouping by domain
- set widget for table.attributes (CrossSelector) in base class instead of all children
- scatter: why did I have shared_axes = False?
- see if we still need to check for set experiment data in table.data_view()
- see that we don't waste time when reports are initialized with specific values
  -> also a problem when clicking link?
  -> should help prepare for use in jupyter
- Floatpanel does not close when removed programmatically
- Floatpanel wrong height (see eg https://discourse.holoviz.org/t/tabulator-in-floatpanel-height-size-is-not-correct-mre-when-the-floatpanel-is-dynamically-added/6497)
  -> cannot use sizing_mode = "stretch_both" (table disappears completely)
